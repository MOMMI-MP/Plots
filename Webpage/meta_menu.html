		<h3>Mouse strains:</h3>
			<p>Users can view box-plots for abundance of identified differentially abundant metabolites in each mouse strain. <br>Samples at gestational time points G15 and G19 were grouped together and compared to all the remaining time points<br> were grouped together. The PERMANOVA analysis was performed on those two groups for every individual feature.<br><br> The result obtained was an adjusted p-value table that describes the significance of separation between the groups for <br>individual features. Metabolite features with adjusted p-values less than 0.05 are considered differentially abundant and<br> metabolite features with adjusted p-values less than 0.4 are reported in the table. </p>
